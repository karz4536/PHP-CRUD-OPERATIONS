A student database management system is designed to make the management of student data such as storage, tracking, and monitoring information simple and easy. It also enables school authorities to share relevant information with students, teachers, and parents. This includes everything from student registration and admission to billing and availability of financial aid to deserving students. The SDBMS makes the process of student enrollment quick, systematic, and error-free. As the entire data is saved at a central location, typically in the cloud, and role-based access to data is granted to each stakeholder, the student data remains secure.
<hr><I>CRUD OPERATIONS</I> <bR>

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. As the name suggests, these operations manipulate data in a database that is important to any web applicationâ€™s basic functionality. We can create a PHP application coupled with a MySQL database to perform these operations.

PHP is an open-source, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language that can be executed at the server-side. PHP is well suited for web development. Therefore, it is used to develop web applications (an application that executes on the server and generates the dynamic page.)

Performance:

PHP script is executed much faster than those scripts which are written in other languages such as JSP and ASP. PHP uses its own memory, so the server workload and loading time is automatically reduced, which results in faster processing speed and better performance.


PHP is compatible with almost all local servers used today like Apache, Netscape, Microsoft IIS, etc.

PHP is a secure language to develop the website. It consists of multiple layers of security to prevent threads and malicious attacks.

<H2> <HR> CLOSING THE CONNECTION: <br>
